                    <p>
                        At Created Car Motors we trace our heritage back to the original Car Motors which opened in Sligo in the 50s. We opened our own doors in 1989 and have been providing our customers with the best quality used cars at the best possible value ever since. We are proud to have built lasting relationships with our many customers over the years and to have maintained our independent, family run status for all this time. We're now even open in Mayo, Galway, Leitrim and Roscommon so we're sure to be able to suit your needs!
